# Staz's skills

Claude Code plugins I use every day, for personal and work projects.

## orc

orc is short for orchestrator.

Your main session keeps doing the work. It hands a piece to a tier agent only
when that pays off:

- the piece would fill your context with output you won't need again, such as a broad search or a log dig
- it needs a cheaper model, or a stronger one, or a different effort level
- it splits into independent pieces that can run in parallel

When a piece qualifies, orc asks you first and recommends an option. You can
also ask for a handoff at any time: "hand this off", "send it to tier-fast",
"fan this out".

### Use it

| | |
|---|---|
| `/orc` | Turn handoffs on for this session |
| `/orc <task>` | Get handoff options for one task right away |
| `orc off` | Back to a plain session |
| `claude --agent orc:orchestrator` | Handoffs on from the first turn, for the whole session |

`/orc` is the easy way to try it, because nothing changes until you ask.
`--agent orc:orchestrator` puts the rules in the system prompt, so they hold better
over long sessions.

### Tiers

| Agent | Model, effort | For |
|---|---|---|
| `orc:tier-cheap` (experimental) | Haiku | Lookups, and mechanical commands where the exact command is given. Never edits. |
| `orc:tier-fast` | Sonnet, low | One or two files, an obvious change, a summary |
| `orc:tier-strong` | Opus, medium | Several files, debugging with a repro, tests |
| `orc:tier-max` | your session's model, high | Unclear goal, no repro, or high stakes |
| `orc:tier-strong-wide`, `orc:tier-max-wide` | as above | Same, but may fan out to lower tiers and to parallel searches |
| `orc:tier-all-out` | your session's model, max | Only when you ask for it |

Start your session on Opus, or on Fable if your account has it. Each subagent
starts cold, with roughly 15–25k tokens of context, so orc keeps small and
medium work in your session.
